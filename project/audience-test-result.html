  <h1>Audience Test Result</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
    my audience was enjoyed the game and the design of my project. They said it is simple to understand the game and kind of playful. They played several times while they are waiting for the time.
    </p>
    <nav>
      <h2>The audience give me a feedback of the my project</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>the star is too fast and hard to click, also it makes user to be stressful while the star goes fast. They suggest to Slow it down the star's movement.
        </li>
        <li>Audience also suggests that make the game screen bigger.

        </li>
        <li>Make the gameover image not fade it. Better to coraporate the graph of stastic in the gameover image.

        </li>
      </ul>
  </nav>
    </section>
<p>
I learn a lot of things from the audience. I will change the star little bit slow it down and make size bigger. I will also use the graph as the game over image and take out "statics" Nav. I will work on more of the information page.
