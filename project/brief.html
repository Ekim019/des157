    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>My topic is using the religious to help people to get a positive emotion and attitude to leads from my project. Today in this world, most of people get a lot of stress from the school stuffs, work area, community and society. Therefore, a lot of people
      could not release their stress to anywhere or anyone privately. Moreover, many people could not find out good supporter and listener around community because it is hard to find trustable person and not that much time is allowing to busy people in
      now. So, I was research that mental issue with religious, many of believers could easily release their stress from the religious boundary. It is different each individual person but, most of people who believe in religious, they have someone to
      talk with it such as god. It helps to step farther to go away from the stresses. So, I want to create a game that people could play as fun guide and releases their stress during they are play the games.
