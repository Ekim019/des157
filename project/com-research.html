      <h2>URI(United Religions Initiative)</h2>
      <p> <br>The first website, “URI (United Religions Initiative)” has bright colors on the interface that has the audience’s attention captive and interested to interact. It means that there are more images and less text on the home (index) file/page. This
        prevents boredom as people scroll the site. They show in main page about what is their pointed at, therefore, the user could understand easily what the website is talking about. Moreover, when the user scrolls down to bottom, their world map interactive
        helps the user for diversity of religion and cooperation. They have many different sub navigations to go to different section of the page. Most interesting aspect is the yellow highlight on the sentence that what is important to reader and keep
        the quick eye stop. Furthermore, the yellow and green color scheme are a great choice because it’s give user to keep calm and better to see this website. Also, it is interesting that they follow the logo color to matches the website nav, icons,
        page, and text. Additionally, when user scrolls down to the bottom, the nav stays on the top and follow together help people to quickly access to another page and source in the website. There are many interactive features such as mouse hover and
        motions could help give the audience could give interesting. Moreover, this website’s audience is all age range because it’s easy to understand, has more color and is visually attractive. Some time if the website is more on the visual side, the
        information is missing. But, this website give different culture religion of history, and many simple understandable information to keep in a single page. Moreover, the font size is also big enough to easy to read the text. Most of research page
        or deep information website has small font and a lot of hard vocabulary as well. That causes the user to get bored and not revisit the website. This website is really interesting to look over the diversity of religion and easy to understand of
        different type of religion in this world.</p>

      <h2>Pew Research Center</h2>
      <p>Another website called “Pew Research center” is different than the first website because this has a lot of text with research base website. Therefore, this user is mostly targeted to college students all the way to adulthood. There are some visual
        of the diagram that gives how many percentage of the religion has. There are a lot of texts that many information. The top nav does not follow when user scrolling down to the footer. This website is more toned down because they don’t want to pop
        up the other stuff (nav color, icons) for not effect to reading the text. The bottom of page has the citation to clear of the text information. In the footer, they have hover effect that user could interact the where they want to click and quickly
        access through to other page. There media screen also range to the phone interact as well because the nav tab change to phone size view. So, help user to read on their phone to interact. They put the two important subsections in main nav such
        as menu and research area. So, the more sub nav fall trough bottom when user clicked. But, when I changed the phone size view on this website, the text is still small to read. Another point of view that the first website even I changed the phone
        size view, it still readable the text because it was short and the font size was still big enough to read the text. Moreover, the related research paper contents gives on the right side with bold title. Therefore, the user could get drawn in from
        the title to access through another page. While, user access though phone this right title page goes bottom of the page to fit the size of the media size. This website also interesting that the icons of social media or other things (print) in
        the top of the body and still has footer. This website gives more classic of website and the first website give more on modern side of website.
