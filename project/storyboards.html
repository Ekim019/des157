      <p>From this activity, I learn a lot of things from the partner conversation. It was really helped. First partner gives me positive feedback such as interesting game plan that interact positive emotional could help the audience. The target audience
        might help from my project like, the people's emotion and mental issue with the religious. Moreover, it was really interesting feedback to know to change the planes. Second partner gives me really good point about the religious information that
        comes in the game over, need to fix. Suggest from the partner, the beginning of game tell the audience briefly information about the religious because non-believer might surprise if I did not mention in the first of the game. I put the religious
        information at the end with the game over. Also, the partner recommended that think more about the target audience about the non-believers VS believers and more specific that lead to guide the project better.
