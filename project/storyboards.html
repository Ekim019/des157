      <p>From this activties, I learn alot of things from the partnership converstion. First partner give me positive feedback such as interesting game that
        help the people's emotion and mental issue with the reiligous. Moreover, it was really interesting topic to know. Second partner give really good point abou the religous
        such as when the game start, give breif information about the religous because non-beliver might suprise at the end of game. Because I put the religous information at the end of the gameover,
        but that is not good for audience. Also, think more about the target audience about the non-belivers VS belivers and speicific to guide the project means.
